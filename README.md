The Mechanics for Point Break includes:
	Hover Ship movement, Upgrades and Customization, Racetracks, and Coop Opponent.

**Physics:** The ship is made to hover at a specific height, keeping gravity in mind. Moreover, the angle of roll is set accurately, so it’s easier for the car to take turns and avoid the railings.

**Movement:** The ship has simple movement. WASD are used for player one while the arrow keys are for the second player.
 
**Objects:** The tracks are made using a unity system called RoadArchitect. It enabled us to create tracks with railings. Furthermore, there are multiple objects on the terrain like buildings, hills, mountains, lakes. These all are added using different prefabs from the internet. 
 
**Actions:** The track is set to ground layer meanwhile railings, buildings, graves, walls are set to wall layer to detect collisions. 
One of the cars is set to default layer while the other is set to wall layer so the game detects the collision between both cars.
 
**Screen Switch:** The game starts with the Main Menu and the player is asked to select a lap track. After completing the tracks, the players are taken back to the track list so the players can select the next track to play.
Game Options: The game has different setting from setting the sound and audio level to adjusting the brightness of the whole game.

The camera is hooked to the car so that it follows the car throughout the track and positions itself at a specific angle when making a turn.

For audio we have used a single Engine Hum voice used when the car accelerates.
